# Pizza-Sales-Analysis-and-Visualization

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing pizza sales data to derive insights, trends, and key performance indicators (KPIs) using SQL and Power BI. The raw data, consisting of pizza sales information, will be imported into an SQL database for efficient querying and manipulation. The project encompasses several stages, each contributing to a comprehensive analysis and visualization of the pizza sales data.

Data Import and Preparation:

Raw sales data will be imported into an SQL database for centralized storage and ease of access.
Necessary data cleaning and preprocessing steps will be applied to ensure data integrity and quality.
SQL Queries for Analysis:

Daily and monthly sales trends will be analyzed using SQL queries to identify patterns, peaks, and troughs in pizza sales.
SQL queries will calculate the percentage of sales by category and size to provide insights into customer preferences.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Calculation:

Relevant KPIs, such as average order value, total revenue, and customer retention rate, will be calculated through SQL queries.
These KPIs will serve as vital metrics to gauge the performance and success of the pizza sales.
Power BI Integration and Visualization:

The SQL database will be connected to Power BI for interactive and visually appealing data representation.
Power Query will be used for data cleaning and transformation, ensuring accurate and consistent visualization.
Interactive Dashboards:

Daily and monthly trend charts will be designed to visualize sales patterns and fluctuations over time.
Dashboards will display the percentage of sales by category and size, accompanied by insightful observations.
Worst and Best Sellers Analysis:

A dedicated dashboard will be created to showcase the worst and best-performing pizza items.
Insights will be provided to understand factors contributing to success or underperformance.
Navigator Buttons and User Experience:

Navigator buttons will be added to enhance user experience, allowing easy navigation between different dashboards and sections.
Conclusion and Insights:

The project concludes with an overview of the key findings and insights derived from the analysis.
Visualizations and dashboards will be presented to provide a clear understanding of the pizza sales trends and patterns.
By combining SQL analysis, Power BI visualization, and insightful dashboard creation, this project aims to provide a comprehensive overview of pizza sales performance, helping stakeholders make informed decisions and improve overall business strategies.
